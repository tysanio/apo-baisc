Should I do the following things in OnGameModeExit or they are done automatically in the background?

- close files
- close database connections
- save player data (despite doing so in OnPlayerDisconnect)
- destroy global textdraws
- destroy gvars
- destroy gangzones or dynamic areas/pickups/checkpoints/actors
